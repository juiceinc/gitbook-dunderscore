# Welcome to Dunderscore

### Let's get started!

Dunderscore.js is an extension of the flexible templating of underscore.js to add chainable filters that modify template output. These filters are inspired by the usefulness of vega's [datalib templates](http://vega.github.io/datalib/). Dunderscore isn't just a marriage of convenience, it's a lightweight union of two projects we love.

Dunderscore is a drop-in replacement for `_.template`.

Dunderscore is used by [Juicebox](https://juicebox.gitbook.io/juicebox-docs/)
